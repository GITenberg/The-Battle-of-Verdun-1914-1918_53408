<!-- TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES -->

<div class="transnotes">
<p>
 Transcriber’s Notes
</p>
<ul>
<li class="lspace">
A small number of obvious typos have been corrected by the addition of
a missing accent. For example, “Prefecture” and “Eglise” have been
changed to “Préfecture” and “Église”, respectively. Except for this,
the spelling and punctuation of the book have not been changed.
</li>

<li class="lspace">There are six two-page maps in the source book. In
this ebook the image of each of these maps has a double border and is
followed by larger images of its left-hand and right-hand pages.</li>

<li class="lspace">If you are reading the HTML version of this book
then clicking on a two-page map will open a larger image of it.</li>

<li class="lspace">In the source book some photographs are placed side
by side on opposing pages to form a panorama. In this ebook they are
shown side by side in a single figure so you can see the panoramic
view. Each of these photographs is also shown on its own so that some
details that are obscure in the panorama figure can be seen more
easily.</li>

<li class="lspace">The table of contents in the book appears on the
last page of the text as it does in this ebook. Here is a link to
it: <a href="#contents">Contents</a>.
</li>

<li class="lspace">An appendix, not found in the book, has been added
to this ebook: it lists all the photographs and maps in the book with a
link to each of them. </li>

<li class="lspace">Any item in the appendix or any caption of an
illustration that is enclosed in square brackets has been added by the
transcriber and does not appear in the source book.
</li>

<li class="lspace">
Near the beginning of the chapter entitled <b>THE WAR OF 1914–18</b>
there is a reference to
<p class="center">
“<b>The Battle of the Marne</b>,” part III., “<i>The Revigny
Pass</i>”.</p> This is another Michelin guide but it is <i>not</i> the
one that has been posted to the Gutenberg site. If you are interested,
see this book on <b>archive.org</b>—Battlefields of the
World War, Vol I. Part III is on pages 215–289. See:
https://archive.org/details/michelinguidetob00mill.

<h2>VERDUN</h2>

<h3>ORIGIN AND POLITICAL HISTORY</h3>

<p><b>Verdun</b>, one of France’s most ancient cities, was first a
Gallic, then under the name of “Virodunum Castrum,” a Roman fortress.
In 843 the celebrated treaty which divided the Carolingian Empire and
annexed Verdun to the Kingdom of Lorraine was signed there. From 870 to
879 Verdun became part of France, but in 923 it was incorporated in the
German Empire. As a county, it was governed under the feudal system by
the hereditary counts, the last of whom was Godefroy de Bouillon, and
later by the episcopal counts and bishops.</p>

<p>In the 10th century, Bishop Haimont, of Verdun, persuaded the Count of
Verdun to transfer his rights to him. The arrangement was confirmed by
Emperor Othon III., but the count’s heirs disputed the bishops’ title to the
town. Later, the burgesses revolted against the authority of the bishops,
and after a sanguinary struggle succeeded in throwing off their yoke about
the middle of the 13th century. After a long occupation by the Germans,
Henri II., King of France, retook Verdun in 1552 and granted it privileges
which were confirmed by François II. in 1559. During the Religious Wars,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
the town was for the Leaguers, and only agreed to receive Henry IV.’s envoy,
after that prince’s conversion to the Roman Faith. The burgesses did not
take the oath of allegiance to the King of France until 1601.</p>


<h3>CHIEF MILITARY EVENTS</h3>

<p>Both in respect of its geographical position and history, Verdun is
a typical fortified town. From time immemorial it has played an
important part in resisting invasion, as witness its fortified camp and
citadel. Since 1870 it has been the centre of an essential position
formed by a rough hemi-cycle of hills and slopes bristling with
defensive works and batteries.</p>

<p>Since the year 450, when Attila left it “like a field ravaged by
wild beasts,” it has been besieged at least ten times.</p>

<p>Charles Quint besieged and took it in 1544, but after a seven years’
occupation it was retaken by Henry II. of France in 1552. The Huguenots
tried to take it by surprise in 1589, but were unable to overcome the
resistance of the burgesses.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Siege of 1792.</b>—In 1792, the Prussians attacked and bombarded
the town, defended by Beaurepaire with only thirty-two guns and
forty-four artillerymen. The Council of Defence, urged thereto by the
Anti-Republican section of the population, decided to capitulate, in
spite of opposition on the part of Beaurepaire, who died suddenly soon
afterwards at the Town Hall by his own hand, according to some, others
holding that he was assassinated. The Prussians occupied the town for
six weeks, after the garrison had left. Although it is true that a few
women went to the Camp of Bras with an offering of sweetmeats for the
King of Prussia, it has not been established that the latter gave a
ball at Regret, at which the women of Verdun danced. The victory of
Valmy forced the Prussians to leave Verdun. On October 13th Kellermann
took possession of the Citadel, and on the 14th the troops of the
Republic entered the town. Several of the visitors to the Camp of Bras
expiated their regrettable act on the scaffold.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Siege of 1870.</b>—In 1870, Verdun offered a more stubborn
resistance. When the Saxon troops, about 10,000 in number, appeared to
the east of the town, the garrison of the latter comprised only 1,500
regular troops, including fifty artillerymen, 2,000 “mobiles” (newly
levied men) and 1,400 men of the National Sedentary Guard, while its
armament consisted of twenty mortars, two howitzers and ninety-six
guns, of which only forty-six were rifled. Under the command of General
Guérin de Waldersbach, seconded by General Marmier, this small garrison
repulsed an attack on August 24th, and refused to surrender. After
being reinforced by 2,600 men who had escaped from Sedan, several
sallies were made. By September 23rd the enemy had completely encircled
the town, and were forcing the inhabitants of the surrounding villages
to help with the siege-works. On the night of October 19th thirty
sappers, twenty-five artillerymen and 100 foot soldiers surprised the
two German batteries on Heyvaux Hill, between Thierville and Regret, on
the left bank, and after hand-to-hand fighting, spiked all the
guns.</p>

<p>After the fall of Metz, Verdun, besieged by 15,000 men with 140
heavy guns, in addition to field artillery, surrendered on November 8th
with the honours of war.</p>

<p>The town had been bombarded three times. On August 24th it received
about 2,000 shells; on September 26th the Citadel received 1,000 to 1,200
shells in five hours; on October 13th, 14th and 15th 20,000 to 25,000 shells
fell in the town, severely damaging the upper part and the Citadel.</p>
<p>The name of the German Prefect who governed Verdun and the Meuse
province was Von Bethmann Hollweg.</p>

<p>In 1914, during the battle of the Marne, the army under General
Sarrail, resting on Verdun, formed the pivot for Marshal Joffre’s
manœuvre (<i>see the Michelin Guide</i>: “<b>The Battle of the
Marne</b>,” part III.,“<i>The Revigny Pass</i>”).</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="map001">
<img alt="" src="images/map001.jpg" />
<div class="caption">VERDUN—PIVOT OF THE BATTLE OF THE MARNE.</div>
</div>

<p>After the battle of the Marne, the Crown Prince established his
positions of resistance north of the fortress, on the line
Malancourt—Brabant—Haumont—Maucourt. On September 15th, General
Sarrail slipped in from this side the 6th C.A. and 72nd R.D., which
were sent beyond the advance forts. The enemy sought to isolate and
approach Verdun at the same time. The combats which occurred
successively on the initiative of each side were indecisive on the
north, but not on the S.E.</p>

<p>On September 20th the IIIrd Bavarian Corps attacked the 75th R.D. at
Vigneuilles-les-Hatton châtel, and after forcing it to retreat, reached
the Meuse Heights. The 6th Corps was hastily transferred to this
region, where it checked the German advance. Further to the right, at
St. Mihiel, the enemy succeeded on the 25th in forcing the passage of
the Meuse and occupied Chauvoncourt.</p>

<p>During October, November and December, the adversaries harassed one
another without intermission. In the vicinity of St. Mihiel the enemy
maintained their positions on the left bank of the river.</p>

<p>So far from besieging Verdun, as the <i>Wolff News Agency</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
falsely announced, or entering it, as a postcard circulated throughout
Germany, entitled “<i>Combats in the streets of Verdun,</i>” tried to
make believe, the Crown Prince was held in check on the general line
Vauquois—Malancourt—Brabant—Bois&zwj;&nbsp;&zwj;des&zwj;&nbsp;&zwj;Caures—Ornes—Fromezey—Hennemont—Combres—Lamorville—Spada—Chauvoncourt.
These positions were but slightly modified up to the time of the big
attack in February, 1916.</p>

<p>In February, 1915, the city was bombed by aeroplanes, while the
forts of Douaumont and Vaux were shelled by heavy artillery, including
17-inch guns. The Eparges crest, stubbornly held by the enemy since
September, 1914, was definitely taken on April 6th by the 12th D.I.
after more than a month of the fiercest fighting. This brilliant action
was followed by violent counter-attacks by the Vth German corps, the
combats being particularly furious on April 24th and May 5th, after
which the fighting was less desperate.</p>

<p>On November 25th–26th the enemy attacked to the N.W.
of the city, but despite the liberal use of poison gas, they failed to
reach the French lines.</p>

<p>Further attacks by the Germans against Forges on January 12th and at
Caures Wood on February 12th, 1916, were unsuccessful.</p>

<h3>THE BATTLE OF VERDUN</h3>

<p>A battle which was destined to last much longer than the entire
Franco-German war of 1870–1871, and which absorbed the efforts of
Germany throughout the year, began on February 21st, 1916.</p>

<p>The choice of this battlefield was perhaps less paradoxical than has
been said. For the German High Command to take Verdun was to crush the
French right, capture an important strategical position and secure an
immense moral effect. Moreover, the enemy feared an Allied offensive
and was disturbed by the continued increase of their strength in men
and material. To forestall this offensive was to make it fail and keep
the initiative of the operations. Moreover, the Germans desired to
impress the public opinion of the world, which had begun to doubt their
ultimate victory. Greece and Roumania seemed inclined to abandon their
neutrality, and the time appeared ripe to prove by a crushing blow that
German force had not diminished. Lastly, they were influenced by home
political considerations; the rationing of the population had depressed
the public <i>morale</i> and provoked dissension between the political
parties and the states; the prestige of the Crown Prince, after his
failure in the Argonne, had considerably declined; a great victory was
necessary to strengthen German <i>morale</i>, appease dissension and,
by rehabilitating the Crown Prince, enhance the prestige of the
Imperial family.</p>

<div class="caption">GENERALS JOFFRE AND PÉTAIN AT THE G.H.Q. OF THE 2ND
FRENCH ARMY AT<br />SOUILLY, IN FEBRUARY, 1916.</div>
</div>

<p>The Germans, who had fourteen railways at their disposal, and who,
during a long and careful preparation, had concentrated seven army corps
and extraordinarily powerful artillery, comprising at least 3,000 guns of all
calibres, attacked the French, who had a river in their rear and whose one
solitary broad-gauge railway was under enemy gun-fire. By sacrificing
men and material on a lavish scale the enemy counted on rapidly
overcoming all obstacles, level the French trenches, crush the centres
of resistance under a deluge of 17-inch, 15-inch and 12-inch shells,
isolate them with barrage fire from 8-inch guns and poison-gas shells,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
and occupy the destroyed positions—such were to be the German tactics.
They were so sure, by repeated smashing blows, of breaking through
between Bras and Douaumont, and, by their attack on Verdun, of forcing
the French to withdraw their wings, that they neglected first to attack
the French positions on the left bank and in the Woevre plain, with the
result that their colossal effort broke down before the tenacious
resistance and heroism of the French.</p>

<div class="caption">THE “SACRED WAY,” AND THE NARROW-GAUGE MEUSE RAILWAY.</div>
<p class="subcapit">
In February, 1916, only one broad-gauge railway connected
Verdun, via St. Menehould, with the rest of France. At the outset of
the offensive it was cut by enemy gun-fire between Parois and
Dombasle. There remained the narrow-gauge Meuse railway and the road.
The carrying capacity of the former was increased to 2,000 tons per
day, while the motor service along the “Sacred Way” was organised to
such a pitch that it was able to ensure the transport of the troops,
the evacuation of the wounded and the revictualling of 250,000
combatants.

<h3>THE GERMAN OFFENSIVE</h3>

<p class="h3sub">February–August, 1916</p>

<h4>1.—The Central Attack</h4>

<p>At the beginning of the battle, the first French lines were <i>on
the left bank</i>, from Avocourt Wood to Forges, <i>via</i> the slopes
in front of Malancourt and Béthincourt; <i>on the right bank</i>, from
Brabant-sur-Meuse to Fromézey, <i>via</i> Haumont, Haumont Wood, Caures
Wood, La Ville Wood, Herbébois, Ornes and Maucourt. On the morning of
February 21st and simultaneously with a bombardment of the entire
French front, the enemy began the systematic shelling of Verdun, whose
last residents were evacuated on the 25th at noon.</p>

<p>The infantry attacked at 4.45 p.m. from Haumont Wood to Ornes. The
51st and 72nd divisions sustained the first shock of the IIIrd and
XVIIIth C.A. and the XIIIth division of the VIIth R.C. A heroic combat
followed the most formidable artillery preparation ever known till
then. In Caures Wood the Chasseurs, under <i>Colonel Driant</i>,
resisted foot by foot. When night fell, the enemy’s progress was
insignificant, compared with his sacrifices. However, they succeeded in
taking Haumont Wood.</p>

<p>On the 22nd the bombardment was resumed with, if possible, greater
intensity. In Caures Wood <i>Colonel Driant</i> resisted until death
overtook him, having first evacuated his Chasseurs to Beaumont.
Meanwhile, the sectors of Woevre and the left bank of the Meuse were
violently shelled.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="map005">
<img alt="" src="images/map005.jpg" />
<div class="caption">THE CENTRAL ATTACK.</div>
<p class="subcap1 italic">This attack (February 21st–26th), on the
right bank of the Meuse, shortened the enemy’s front as progressed. It
came to a stop on the sixth day at Poivre Hill and Douaumont.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>The fighting on the 23rd was even more furious. Brabant fell into
the hands of the enemy after a fierce resistance by the 351st I.D.,
which clung desperately to the ruins of Samogneux until nightfall.
Further east the battle raged fiercely. The French counter-attacked
unsuccessfully at Caures Wood and were attacked at Herbebois. The 51st
I.D. fell back, making the enemy pay dearly for his progress towards
Fosses Wood.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="map006">
<img alt="Attack on 21 Februarj 1919."
       src="images/map006.jpg" />
</div>

<p>In the evening the front extended along the Samogneux—Beaumont—Ornes
line. Samogneux was captured by the enemy during the night. The
situation was very critical.</p>

<p>Exasperated at the resistance of the French, and having received reinforcements,
the Germans made a supreme effort on the 24th. Although
harassed by French artillery on the left bank of the Meuse, they succeeded in
taking Hill 344 to the east of Samogneux, Fosses Wood, Chaume Wood and
the village of Ornes. French reinforcements arrived the same day, and the
command of the army of Verdun passed from General de Castelnau to General
Pétain.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig007">
<img alt="" src="images/fig007.jpg" />
<div class="caption"><i>Starting-point of the German Attack of February
21st, North of Haumont Wood.</i></div>
</div>

<p>On the 25th, the 37th I.D., with orders to defend Talou Hill and
Louvemont village, resisted for a long time against incredibly furious
attacks, but on their right the enemy succeeded in capturing Vauche
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
Wood and, advancing towards Douaumont, carried the fort by surprise.
However, their efforts to take the village failed before the heroic
tenacity of the 31st Brigade, while the 94th D.I. covered itself with
glory. The enemy advance from this side, had the effect of compelling
the 31st I.D. to abandon Talou Hill. During this time the line in
Woevre was, unknown to the Germans, voluntarily withdrawn to the foot
of the Meuse hills, where the French only retained outposts at Fresnes
and Manheulles.</p>

<p>Taking over the command on the night of the 25th, General Pétain at
once divided the battle-line into four sectors, officered as follows:
<i>General Bazelaire</i>, on the left bank, from Avocourt to the river;
<i>General Guillaumat</i>, from the Meuse to Douaumont; <i>General
Balfourier</i>, from this point to the Woevre; <i>General Duchesne</i>,
on the Meuse Heights.</p>

<p>There were no trenches, but he ordered that the forts should at
least be connected by a continuous line of entrenchments to be made
while the battle was at its height and which the “poilus,” in their
disdain for the shovel and pick, called the “Panic Line.” The entire
59th division was told off to organise the counter slopes on the second
and third lines. Thirteen battalions kept in repair the road from
Bar-le-Duc to Verdun, <i>via</i> Souilly (the <b>“Sacred Way”</b>),
which eventually became the main artery for revictualling the place in
men and munitions, and along which 1,700 motor lorries passed each way
daily. Lastly, General Pétain managed to imbue all under his command
with his energy, activity and faith, and the enemy’s drive was
stopped.</p>

<p>On the 26th, the 39th D.I., which had relieved the 37th,
victoriously repulsed all attacks on Poivre Hill, while the 31st
Brigade continued to hold Douaumont until relieved in the evening by
the 2nd D.I.</p>

</div>

<p>On the following days the fighting continued about and in the
streets of Douaumont, which the enemy finally captured on March 4th.
The Germans now began to show signs of weakening. Their effort on the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
right bank had failed. Checked at Douaumont, they were taken in the
rear by the French positions on the left bank, and were obliged to
modify their plans. From that time they operated simultaneously or
successively on both banks.</p>

<h4>2.—The General Attack</h4>

<p class="h4sub">(<i>See <a href="#map007">map, pp.&nbsp;14 and 15</a></i>)</p>

<p>On March 6th two German divisions attacked from Béthincourt to
Forges, where the French front was held by the 67th D.I., and
succeeded in taking Forges and Regnéville, but were checked by the
positions on Oie Hill. Continuing their advance on the 7th, they
succeeded in capturing these positions, as well as Corbeaux Wood. The
village of Cumières was the scene of terrible fighting, but remained
in the hands of the French, while further to the west the enemy’s
attacks broke down at Mort-Homme.</p>

<p>On March 8th, while on the left bank, French troops retook Corbeaux
Wood, the Germans brought into line units of five army corps and began
a general attack, which failed with very heavy losses, their only gain
being the capture of part of Vaux village.</p>

<p>On the 9th they succeeded in getting a footing on the slopes of
Mort-Homme, but at the other end of the battle-line their attack on
Vaux Fort failed. Their radiograms announcing the capture of the fort
were untrue.</p>

<p>On the 10th, Corbeaux Wood was taken by the Germans and the French
withdrew to the line Béthincourt, Mort-Homme, south of Corbeaux and
Cumières Wood and Cumières village. The battle continued in the
village and in front of Vaux Fort, strongly held by the French. The
enemy temporarily ceased his massed attacks. In reality their
offensive had failed, while their losses in men and munitions had been
exceptionally heavy. On March 10th Joffre was able to say to the
soldiers of Verdun: “<i>For three weeks you have withstood the most
formidable attack which the enemy has yet made. Germany counted on the
success of this effort, which she believed would prove irresistible,
and for which she used her best troops and most powerful
artillery. She hoped by the capture of Verdun to strengthen the
courage of her Allies and convince neutrals of German superiority. But
she reckoned without you! The eyes of the country are on you. You
belong to those of whom it will be said: ‘They barred the road to
Verdun.’</i>&thinsp;”</p>

  <p class="noindent italic smaller">The Central Attack which was to
capture Verdun and force back the French wings failed. The Germans,
caught on the flank by French artillery posted on the left bank of the
Meuse, attacked alternately on both sides of the river. The struggle
continued desperately at Mort-Homme, Hill 304, Cumières, Fleury, and as
far as the approaches of Souville Fort—extreme limit of the German

  (<span class="italic smaller">see translation below</span>).</div>
</div>

<p>From March 11th to April 9th the aspect of the battle changed. Wide
front attacks gave place to local actions, short, violent and limited in scope.
On March 14th the Germans captured Hill 265, forming the western portion
of the Mort-Homme position, from the 75th French Brigade, whose commander
Colonel Garçon, fell, rifle in hand, but they failed to take the eastern part, Hill
295. On the 20th, Avocourt and Malancourt Woods fell to the Bavarians,
and after a fierce struggle the village of Malancourt was lost on March 31st,
Haucourt on April 5th, and Béthincourt on April 8th.</p>

<p>On the right bank, after powerful attacks near Vaux, the enemy reached
Caillette Wood and the Vaux-Fleury railway, only to be driven back by the
5th division (Mangin).</p>

<p>A furious attack was made along both banks by the Germans at noon on
April 9th; <i>on the left bank</i>, five divisions were engaged,
failing everywhere except at the Mort-Homme, where, despite the heroic
resistance of the 42nd division (Deville), they gained a footing on the
N.E. slopes; <i>on the right bank</i>, Poivre Hill was attacked but
remained in French hands.</p>

<p>“<i>April 9th was a glorious day for our armies</i>,” General Pétain
declared in his order of the day dated the 10th, “<i>the furious
attacks of the soldiers of the Crown Prince broke down everywhere. The
infantry, artillery, sappers and aviators of the 2nd Army vied with one
another in valour. Honour to all. No doubt the Germans will attack
again. Let all work and watch, that yesterday’s success be continued.
Courage! We shall beat them!</i>”</p>

</div>

<p>On the 10th the enemy continued his efforts with small success.</p>

<p>From that date operations were limited to local actions, either in reply
to French counter-offensives (attacks of April 11th between Douaumont
and Vaux and between the Meuse and Douaumont on the 17th), or in
endeavours to take key positions where the French offered vigorous
resistance. At the beginning of May General Pétain, having received the
command of the central group of armies, General Nivelle took over that
of the army of Verdun.</p>

</div>

<p>From May 4th to 24th the Germans attacked furiously around Mort-Homme.
On the 4th they captured the northern slopes of Hill 304, where
desperate combats took place on the 5th and 6th. By a powerful attack
on the 7th they forced the French to abandon the crest of Hill 304, which,
however, they were unable to occupy on account of the violence of the
bombardment. Cumières and Caurettes fell on the 24th.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the battle had started afresh on the Douaumont—Vaux
front. On May 22nd, at 11.50 a.m., the French 5th D.I. attacked and recaptured
the fort of Douaumont, the casemates of which were the scene of
desperate hand-to-hand fighting. The French were driven out on the 24th,
but maintained their positions in the immediate vicinity.</p>

<p>The battle continued without respite or quarter. Not an hour passed
without a surprise of some sort being attempted. The Germans were determined
to advance, but at every step they were checked by the unflinching
will of the French not to let them pass.</p>

<p>From May 29th to 31st the enemy attacked Hill 304 and at Mort-Homme.
June 1st was marked by the loss of the Hardaumont salient and Thiaumont
Farm. On the 2nd the enemy progressed in Fumin Wood, but lost Thiaumont
Farm. On the 3rd they gained a footing in Vaux Fort, which was entirely
in their possession on the 8th. On the 9th they attacked Hill 304 and
Damloup Battery and retook Thiaumont Farm. On the 12th they
advanced along La Dame Ravine, but lost the N.E. slopes of Mort-Homme
on the 15th.</p>

<p>On the 23rd, after an uninterrupted bombardment, begun the day before,
the Germans launched their greatest attack. Seventeen regiments were
hurled simultaneously against the Thiaumont—Fleury—Souville front,
resulting in the capture of the Thiaumont redoubt and the gaining of
a footing in the village of Fleury, but failing to take the fort of Souville.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
Froide-Terre Hill, momentarily invaded, was cleared of the enemy by a
grenade and bayonet attack.</p>

<p>On the following days, the fighting centred around the Thiaumont redoubt,
which changed hands many times, remaining finally with the enemy on
June 30th.</p>

<p>Combats, frequent and furious, continued on both banks until the middle
of August.</p>


<h3>FRENCH COUNTER-OFFENSIVES—CLEARING VERDUN</h3>

<p class="h3sub">October–December, 1916–August, 1917</p>

<h4>The French Offensive of October 24th, 1916, on the Right Bank
of the Meuse</h4>

<p>From August, 1916, the Germans, in consequence of the Franco-British
offensive in the Somme, gradually abandoned Verdun, in which venture she
had sacrificed the pick of her troops. The army of Verdun took advantage
of this to regain the initiative of the operations.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig014">
<img alt="" src="images/fig014.jpg" />
<div class="caption italic">General Mangin in front of his Post of Commandment.</div>
</div>

<p>Under the command of General Mangin the French attacked from Thiaumont
to Laufée Wood on October 24th, 1916, the artillery preparation by
650 guns, including the new 15-inch and 16-inch mortars, beginning on
October 20th. On the 22nd a feint attack enabled French aeroplanes to
locate 158 enemy batteries, which were heavily shelled the next day.</p>

<p>That the Germans did not realise the position was evident from the
Crown Prince’s announcement that he had broken a strong French
attack. The real attack took place on the morning of the 24th (<i>see
map, <a href="#Page_20">p.&nbsp;20</a></i>).</p>

<p>The German front was held on the first line by seven divisions. The
French attacked with three divisions: the 38th (Guyot de Salins), supported
on the left by the 11th line regiment; the 133rd (Passaga), known as “La
Gauloise”; the 74th (de Lardemelle).</p>

<img alt="The French Offensive of 2016-10-24"
       src="images/map008.jpg" />
</div>

<p>The attack was a brilliant success and gave the French the Haudromont
quarries, Thiaumont redoubt and farm, Douaumont fort and village, the
northern edge of Caillette Wood, Vaux pond, the eastern edge of Fumin
Wood and Damloup battery. On the 24th and 25th more than 6,000
prisoners, fifteen guns, and considerable quantities of material, were captured.
On November 2nd, when the French re-entered Vaux Fort, abandoned by
the enemy, they practically reoccupied their positions of February 24th.</p>

<h4>The French Offensive of December 15th, 1916, on the Right Bank
of the Meuse</h4>

<p>To completely clear Verdun to the east of the Meuse and give greater
freedom to the reconquered forts of Vaux and Douaumont, General Mangin
organised a new attack. A great amount of preparatory work was done by
the army of Verdun, including about eighteen miles of road (whereof one of
logs laid transversely for the artillery), more than six miles of narrow-gauge
railway, and a network of trenches and depots for munitions and material.
As soon as these very considerable preparations, often carried out under
heavy enemy shell-fire, were finished, the attacking troops took up their
positions: the 126th D.I. (Muteau), 38th D.I. (Guyot de Salins), 37th D.I.
(Garnier-Duplessis) and 133rd D.I. (Passaga), with the 123rd, 128th, 21st
and 6th D.I. as reserves. Two lines of artillery prepared and sustained the
attack: one from Vacherauville to Thiaumont, Fleury and Souville, the
other passing through Belleville, St. Michel Hill and Tavannes Fort. The
six-mile German front from Vacherauville to Bezonvaux was held by five
divisions in the first line, with four divisions in reserve.</p>

<p>On December 15th, while Germany was proposing that France should
ask for peace, the reply came in the form of attacking waves protected
by a moving curtain of artillery fire.</p>

<p>Several of the objectives, including Vacherauville, Poivre Hill, Hill 342
and the first and second lines before Louvemont, were reached in a few minutes
at a single bound. Albain and Chauffour Woods, those in front of Douaumont
and Helly Ravine, took longer to capture. To the east La Vauche Wood
was carried at the point of the bayonet, Caurières Wood passed, and the
edges of Chaume Wood reached. The farm of Les Chambrettes and village
of Bezonvaux were taken on the following days. The success was considerable,
more than 11,000 prisoners, including 300 officers, 115 guns, several
hundred machine-guns and important depots of munitions and material,
being captured. The enemy who, in July, had been within a few hundred
yards of Souville Fort, was now more than three miles away. In June, the
<i>Frankfort Gazette</i>, celebrating the German successes at Verdun, declared:
“We have clinched our victory and none can take it from us,” but on
December 18th they had lost all the ground it had taken five months and
enormous sacrifices to conquer.</p>

<p>In congratulating the troops General Mangin reminded them that Germany
had just invited France to sue for peace, adding that they had been “the
true ambassadors of the Republic.”</p>

<p>On August 20th, 1917, eight divisions attacked from Avocourt Wood on
the west to Bezonvaux on the east, along a fifteen-mile front. Avocourt Wood,
Mort-Homme, Corbeaux Wood and Oie Hill on the left bank; Talou Hill,
the villages of Champ, Neuville and Champneuville, Hill 344, parts of Fosses
Wood, Chaume Wood and Mormont Farm, on the right bank, were captured
by the French, who, the next day, also took Samogneux and Regnéville.
Hill 304, which had thus far resisted, was likewise captured. On the 26th
a further attack from Mormont Redoubt to Chaume Wood brought the
French to the southern outskirts of Beaumont. From the 20th to the 26th
August the captures include 9,500 prisoners, thirty guns, 100 trench mortars
and 242 machine-guns.</p>

<p>The clearing of Verdun was entirely and definitely effected in the autumn
of 1918.</p>

<p>While the 4th French Army, under General Gouraud, attacked between the
Moronvillers Hills and Argonne on September 26th, the American Army, under
General Pershing, took the offensive between the Argonne and the Meuse.</p>

<p>Artillery preparation commenced at 2.30 a.m. and lasted three hours.
At 5.30 a.m. the Americans attacked with great dash the redoubtable enemy
positions on the left bank of the Meuse, capturing Malancourt, Béthincourt
and Forges. Keeping up with the infantry, the artillery crossed the Forges
stream during the morning. The woods, very strongly defended, were cleared
of the enemy, and by noon the Americans had reached Gercourt, Cuisy, the
southern part of Montfaucon and Cheppy.</p>

<p>In the afternoon a desperate battle was engaged on the positions covering
the redoubtable ridge of Montfaucon, the most important enemy observation-post
in the region of Verdun. The Americans wisely turned the ridge on
the right, advancing as far as Septsarges. By evening Montfaucon was surrounded.
The advance, now slower, continued on the 27th and 28th, despite
German counter-attacks. To the west of Montfaucon, Ivoiry and Epinouville
were captured, and thus the ridge fell. The Americans took 8,000
prisoners and 100 guns.</p>

<h4>The Franco-American Offensive of October, 1918</h4>

<p>On the right bank of the Meuse, a French army corps and American troops,
under General Pershing, joined in the struggle, capturing Brabant, Haumont,
Haumont Wood and Caures Wood, while the famous line from which, in
February, 1916, the Crown Prince’s army had attacked Verdun, was soon
reached and passed. By the end of October more than 20,000 prisoners,
150 guns, nearly 1,000 trench-mortars and several thousand machine-guns,
had been captured, while unconquered Verdun was definitely lost to the
Germans. Their retreat was now destined to continue uninterruptedly until
the Armistice.</p>

<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>

<p>The Battle of Verdun was not merely one of the hardest of the War’s
many battles, it was also one of the most serious checks received by the
Germans. The enemy High Command had foreseen neither its amplitude
nor its long duration. Whereas, “according to plan,” Verdun—“Heart of
France”—was speedily to be overpowered by a carefully prepared mass
attack, the Germans found themselves involved in a formidable struggle,
without being able either to obtain a decisive advantage or keep the relatively
small advantages obtained at the beginning of the battle.</p>

<p>The battle did not develop “according to plan,” its successive phases
being determined by circumstances.</p>

<p>The huge numbers of troops which the Germans were compelled to engage
brings out very clearly the immensity of their effort and the different phases
of the struggle.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The first and shortest phase (February 21st–March 1st) was that of the
<b>surprise attack</b> by a large concentration of specially trained troops.</p>

<p>To the six German divisions which had been holding the Verdun sector
since the Battle of the Marne, were added nine full divisions, rested and
trained for attack.</p>

<p>Of these fifteen divisions ten took part in the surprise attack, their losses
being immediately made good by reserves stationed in the rear of each army
corps. At the end of February, in consequence of the French withdrawal in
Woevre, two further divisions strengthened enemy action in that region.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The second phase (March 2nd–April 15th) marked the <b>general attack</b>
on both banks of the Meuse, in place of the surprise attack which had failed.</p>

<p>During this period nine and a half fresh German divisions were engaged,
of which four came from the Eastern front.</p>

<p>At the same time two and a half German divisions were withdrawn and
rested in quiet sectors, while four others were sent to the rear to reform, two
of them being, however, again engaged after twenty days’ rest.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The third phase (April 15th–July 1st) was that of <b>attrition</b>. After the
failure of their general attack and to avoid avowal of their defeat, the Germans
persisted in their attacks on Verdun.</p>

<p>Twelve fresh divisions were engaged, in addition to three others which
had been sent to the rear to reform. On the other hand, fourteen divisions
were withdrawn and sent to the rear, to Russia, or other sectors on the French
front.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The fourth phase (July 1st, 1916, to 1917) was that of the <b>retreat and
stabilisation</b>. The Germans were exhausted and compelled to use their
reserves for the Russian front and especially in the Somme. Their activities
on the Verdun front were limited to making good their losses. However,
they were finally obliged to weaken this front to a point that they were unable
to reply to the French attacks.</p>

<p>From August 21st to October 1st, the Germans brought up only one
division and withdrew four. From October 1st to 24th, three divisions relieved
nearly five. After October 24th the strength of the enemy forces varied only
slightly, the French offensives preventing any further weakening of the front.
The attrition caused by the French attacks of October 24th and December 15th
gave rise only to rapid replacements of about equal importance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>In brief, from February 21st, 1916, to February 1st, 1917, the Germans
engaged fifty-six and a half divisions (or 567 battalions), of which six
divisions appeared successively on both banks of the Meuse, eight others being
also engaged twice and six three times. In reality, in the course of eleven
months, eighty-two and a half German divisions took part in the attacks on
Verdun, which they had expected to crush in a few days with ten to twelve
divisions. The contrast between this formidable effort and the meagre results
obtained is striking, and is a splendid testimony to the courage and tenacity
of the defenders. The Battle of Verdun in 1916 was not merely a severe
local setback for the Germans; by using up their best troops it had also very
important strategical consequences. Their successes were few, temporary,
and dearly bought. Advancing painfully, each step forward was marked by
a mountain of corpses. Up to the end of the War, even after the Battles of
the Somme and Aisne in 1910 and 1917, and after the Battle of Champagne
in 1918, Verdun remained a hideous spectre for the German people, while
their soldiers surnamed it “<b>The Slaughter-House of Germany</b>.”</p>

<p>As the French President, M. Poincaré, declared, on handing to the Mayor
of Verdun the decorations conferred on that city by the Allied nations, it was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
before the walls of Verdun that “the supreme hope of Imperial Germany was
crushed.” It was at Verdun that Germany sought the “kolossal” victory
which was to enslave the world, and it was there that France quietly but
firmly replied “No road.” For centuries to come the name of Verdun will
continue to ring in the ears of humanity like a shout of victory and a cry of
deliverance.</p>

<h4>Verdun Decorated</h4>

<p>It was in a casemate of the Citadel, transformed into a <i>salle de
fêtes</i>, that, on September 13th, 1916, Président Poincaré handed
the undermentioned decorations, conferred on the city by the Chiefs of
State of the Allied countries, to the Municipal Authorities of Verdun:
St. George’s Cross of Russia (white enamel); the British Military
Cross (silver); the medal for military valour of Italy (gold); the
Cross of Leopold I. of Belgium (gold); the medal “Ohilitch” of
Montenegro (gold); the “Croix de la Légion d’Honneur” and the “Croix
de Guerre” of France. Since then the French Government has conferred a
Sword of Honour on the city. Generals Joffre, Pétain and Nivelle, the
Military Governor (General Dubois), the French War Minister and
representatives of the Allied Nations were present at this moving
ceremony, which consecrated the heroic resistance of the army of
Verdun and the German defeat.</p>

<p>The present building was erected in 1890 on the site of the old
college, founded in 1570 by Bishop Nicolas Psaume in the grounds of
the ancient Hôpital de St. Nicolas-de-Gravière. Its church, a fine
Ionic structure, was built in 1730 by the Jesuits. The college was one
of the first buildings to be damaged by the bombardment, being struck
in 1915, prior to the great German offensive against Verdun.</p>

<p>These two buildings are the remains of the second Abbey of the
Premonstrants of St. Paul, built inside the town after 1552.  The
first, situated without the walls, was destroyed by order of the
Military Authorities, who feared a siege by Charles Quint.</p>

<p>In the S<span class="smaller">OUS</span>-P<span
class="smaller">RÉFECTURE</span> vestiges of the ancient monastery are
more numerous and apparent. The <i>Salle des Archives</i>, with its
slender columns and great Renaissance bays, was the monks’ refectory.
The <i>Cabinet du Sous-Préfet</i>, with its austere vaulting, has
retained its archaic appearance. In the <i>Loge du Concierge</i>
(caretaker’s lodge) there still exists one of the original
mantelpieces, with carving representing Abraham sacrificing Isaac. The
marble-paved <i>vestibule</i> and fine <i>staircase</i> are also 16th
century.</p>

<p>The interior arrangement of the Palais de Justice buildings, whose
façade is ornamented with a finely carved semicircular
<i>pediment</i>, has been changed. Of the old convent there now only
remains the Salle des Pas-Perdus, formerly the cloister.</p>

<p>The <b>Hôtel de la Cloche d’Or</b>, near by, has been installed in

of the same date.</p>

<p>The pediment between the two towers was struck by shell splinters,

<h4>THE CATHEDRAL <span class="normw">(<i>hist. mon.</i>)</span></h4>

<p>The Cathedral of Verdun, like that of Angers, was one of the first French
churches to be dedicated to the Virgin. In the 7th or 8th centuries its
patronal festival was The Nativity, but this was changed to The Assumption
at the beginning of the 19th century.</p>

<p>It is an ancient edifice, but has often been restored and altered. The
original 5th-century church, which it replaced, was built on the ruins of a
Roman <i>castrum</i>, like those of Rheims, Metz and Trèves.</p>

<p>The Cathedral was consecrated in 1147 by Pope Eugenius&nbsp;III., assisted by
eighteen cardinals and St.&nbsp;Bernard. The plans were made by the Rhenish
architect Garin, and, contrarily to French practice, included two transepts
and two apses. With its four similar spires, two on each choir, it looked,
according to a popular saying, like a “bahut” (chest of drawers on legs),
turned upside down.</p>

<p>The fire of 1755 caused important alterations to be made which, without
suppressing the main lines of the Cathedral, disfigured the interior. These
alterations explain the lack of harmony in the edifice.</p>

<p>The four Roman towers with spires disappeared after 1755. Only the
two western towers were replaced by the present large ones.</p>

<p>The Cathedral did not greatly suffer from the bombardment of 1916, during
the German offensive, but that of April–May, 1917, damaged it very seriously.
The vaults were either pierced or brought down, and the roof destroyed.
Near the apsis a big shell tore open the ground, bringing to light an unknown
subterranean passage or crypt.</p>

which were destroyed as uncouth.</p>

<p>The portal is placed between two chapels; that on the right (16th
century) is called “The Chaplet,” on account of the chaplets carved on
the buttresses.</p>

<h4>The Towers</h4>

<p>The present bells weigh four and six tons respectively and date
from 1756. They were so cast as to have the same proportions and tones
as those of the St. Germain-des-Prés Church in Paris.</p>

<h4>The Apse of the Great Choir</h4>

<p>The basement is the remains of a Roman apse. The upper portion

the remains of a Pagan altar, a Corinthian capital with Barbarian
ornamentation, and an ivory comb with inscriptions, said to have been
given by Emperor St.&nbsp;Henri to the Abbot of St. Vanne in 1024.</p>

known as <b>Pré-l’Evêque</b>.</p>

<p>The entrance to the <b>Citadelle</b> opens on the Esplanade de la
Roche, while the Citadelle proper occupies the site of the ancient
<b>Abbey</b> and <b>Church of St. Vanne</b>, erected in the
Merovingian Period and 15th century on the hill where, in the days of
Clovis, the Dragon with poisoned breath was said to live. According to
the legend St. Vanne first tamed the dragon, then led it to the River
Meuse, where it was drowned.</p>

<p>The first Citadelle was begun in 1552, continued under
Henri&nbsp;IV. by Errard, and finished in 1630 under Governor Marillac.
The second was the work of Vauban (1670–1682). The church of St. Vanne
was included and preserved in both citadelles, but was later pulled
down (1831–1835) by order of the Military Authorities. The old Gothic
cloister was spared and turned into barracks in 1835. It was destroyed
by the German bombardment during the siege of 1870. Of the Abbey, only
a square Roman Tower of the 11th&nbsp;century remains
(<i>see <a href="#fig064">photo below</a></i>).</p>

<h4>The Citadel during the War</h4>

<p>During the late War, the Citadelle was often a target for the German
heavy guns, but its deep underground vaults provided secure shelter for the
population before the general evacuation, as also for the public services
and reinforcements. Most of the regiments which took part in the battles
of 1916 passed through the Citadelle.</p>

<p>It was in one of the casemates that the President of France, M. Poincaré,
handed to the Municipal Authorities of Verdun, on September 13th, 1916,
the decorations conferred on that City by the Chiefs of State of the Allied
countries (<i>see <a href="#Page_30">p.&nbsp;30</a></i>).</p>

line and the Etain-Verdun road. The Germans, in their effort to reach
Souville, sought by frequent bombardments to destroy the fort which
resisted stubbornly, but on May&nbsp;7th a 17-inch shell destroyed one of
the arches and caused serious damage.</p>

<p>Although the entrances were constantly shelled by enemy artillery, it
was used as a shelter for the reserves of the Vaux-Souville sector and as a
munitions depot. Bunks were fitted up in three superimposed rows, 300 to
450 feet in length, and separated by spaces, where numerous other troops slept
as they could on the ground. Despite the ventilating shafts, the air remained
foul, owing to the perspiration of the men and the rudimentary sanitary
arrangements. To complete the misery of the men, a grenade depot blew up
on the night of September&nbsp;4th, causing many victims.</p>

leading to Vaux Fort, after crossing through the woods of La Laufée and
Chenois, of which only a few broken, branchless trunks remain.</p>

<p><b>Chenois and Laufée Woods and the Damloup Battery.</b>—Before and

<p>From June&nbsp;2nd to 4th the Damloup battery and its approaches,
defended by units of the 142nd and 52nd Line Regiments, repulsed sharp
German attacks and prevented the enemy from debouching from Damloup.
The defence of the battery lasted till July&nbsp;2nd, the defenders, in
constantly diminishing numbers, being attacked and bombarded without
intermission. On July&nbsp;3rd <span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> a German attack, preceded by an intense
bombardment, resulted in the capture at about 1&nbsp;p.m. of the
greater part of the battery, but the remnant of a French company held
its ground in the southern part of the work. At 3&nbsp;p.m. only fifty
men of the company were left; at 8&nbsp;p.m. twenty, but still they
hung on until an hour later they were reinforced by another company,
which succeeded in crossing the barrage. At two&nbsp;o’clock next
morning the French repulsed the enemy at the point of the bayonet and
recaptured the entire battery.</p>

<p><b>Vaux Fort.</b>—Built of masonry about the year 1880, afterwards
of concrete, and finally of reinforced concrete, the fort was only
completed in 1911. Smaller and less powerful than Douaumont Fort, it
dominates the plateau to the south of Vaux Ravine and the reverse side
of Douaumont Plateau. Therein lies its importance. On March&nbsp;9th
Germany announced triumphantly to the world that the VIth and XIXth
reserve regiments of Posen had “taken by assault the armoured Fort of
Vaux, as well as numerous neighbouring fortifications.”</p>

<p>This communiqué was untrue. Two battalions of the XIXth regiment
of Posen had in reality gained a footing on Vaux Hill on March 9th, but they
were mown down at close range by French fire. As a matter of fact, three
months of uninterrupted costly effort were necessary before the Germans were
able to enter Vaux Fort.</p>

<div class="caption">GERMAN ADVANCE ON MARCH&nbsp;8 AND 9, 1916.</div>

<p>On March&nbsp;10th and 11th, in four column formation, they attacked
the slopes leading to the fort. Literally mowed down, regiment after
regiment <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> left
heaps of dead and wounded in front of the French wire entanglements;
60&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent. of the enemy effectives engaged melted away in
these two sanguinary days. After a terrific artillery preparation—five
times on March 16th and six times on March&nbsp;18th—they again swarmed
up the slopes of the fort only to be thrown back with heavy loss. On
April&nbsp;2nd the enemy sustained another check, but during the night
of June&nbsp;2nd they reached the northern moat. While, on
June&nbsp;4th and 5th, six of their divisions attempted unsuccessfully
to outflank the fort on the north by Fumin and on the south by Chenois
Wood, the battle continued to rage on the fort itself and in front of
the southern side.</p>

<div class="caption">VAUX FORT.  THE MOATS IN JUNE, 1916</div>
</div>

<p>From March to June&nbsp;2nd, the fort and its surroundings received
no less than 8,000 large calibre shells daily. Only one entrance was
left, <i>i.e.</i> the north-west postern, which enemy artillery fire
rendered unserviceable. The commander of the fort (Raynal) and his men
were imprisoned in the underground chambers of the fort, being no
longer able to hold their ground outside. To economise food and water,
the surplus contingents were ordered to leave the fort. On the night of
the 4th a first detachment made its escape under the direction of
Aspirant Buffet, who returned to the fort the next evening with orders.
The same night 100 more men managed to get away. Carrier pigeons and
optical signals now furnished the only means of communication with the
French lines. On the 4th, the last pigeon was released. On the morning
of the 5th, thanks to two signalmen who volunteered to change a <span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> signal post which
the Commandant had difficulty in observing, communications were
maintained. The same night the Commandant sent his last message that
could be read in its entirety, and which ended: “We have reached the
limit, officers and soldiers have done their duty. Long live France!”
Nevertheless, the fort continued to hold out and refused to surrender.
On the night of the 6th reinforcements tried to relieve it and reached
the moat of the counter-scarp, but after losing nearly all their
officers they were compelled to fall back. The Germans gained a footing
in the ruins of the superstructure, and eventually succeeded in driving
the French out of the casemates by lowering baskets of grenades with
retarded fuses and by using liquid fire and poison gas. Driven back
into the underground passages, the French continued the fight with
grenades and bayonets. The 2nd&nbsp;regiment of Zouaves and the
Colonial regiment of Morocco made a last effort on the morning of the
8th to relieve the garrison. They reached the approaches of the fort,
from which clouds of thick black smoke, caused by a violent explosion
in one of the casemates, were pouring. Exposed to the fire of the enemy
machine-guns installed in the superstructure of the fort and attacked
by constantly increasing reinforcements, they were unable to hold their
ground.</p>

ruins of this chapel that the enemy reached on July&nbsp;12th, 1916,
and that the 2nd&nbsp;regiment of Zouaves, at the order of General Mangin,
recaptured in order to relieve Souville Fort.</p>

<p><i>At the cross-roads, take the</i> I.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;12 <i>on the

woods of Le Chapitre and Fumin.</i></p>

<p><b>Chapitre and Fumin Woods.</b>—To the west and east of the road
leading to Vaux village, these two woods cover the flanks of the
plateau which dominates Vaux Ravine and supports Vaux Fort. It was
there that the Germans sought to outflank the fort on the west to reach
Souville, but they were held in check during May. From June, 1916,
these woods were subjected to bombardments of incredible intensity. A
powerful German attack on June&nbsp;23rd failed, but another on
July&nbsp;12th enabled the Germans to get a footing in Fumin Wood. In
August and September frequent enemy attacks gave them temporary local
gains. On October&nbsp;24th and 25th, and again at the end of the
month, French counter-attacks captured the enemy strongholds and
cleared the woods completely.</p>

<p>The defence of the “R” outworks by the 101st&nbsp;line regiment was
intimately connected with the attacks on Fumin Wood and Vaux Fort.
These outworks were at the foot of the slopes of Fumin Wood, about
half-way between the village and fort of Vaux. Bombarded by heavy guns
on June&nbsp;1st and 2nd, it was unsuccessfully attacked by the enemy
at 8&nbsp;p.m. on the evening of the 2nd. Twice on the 3rd and once on
the 4th the French, reinforced by a few units, although deprived of
water and subjected to machine-gun fire on the flank, repulsed new
German attacks. A company of the 298th which, on the night of the 5th,
relieved that of the 101st (reduced to 39 men), held out three days
more under increasingly difficult conditions, and was only overpowered
on the night of the 8th after the capture of the fort of Vaux. These
positions were recaptured during the French offensive of October&nbsp;2nd.
1916. The works known as the “Petit Dépôt,” “Fulda Boyau,” and
“Sablière,” bristling with machine-guns and scarcely touched by the
French artillery preparation, offered a stubborn resistance, and were
only captured by the 74th&nbsp;Division in the evening after a whole
day of exceedingly hard fighting.</p>

<p><b>Vaux-les-Damloup.</b>—From March&nbsp;8th the Germans sought to
enter this village from the Woevre. The 1st battalion of their
XIXth&nbsp;regiment of Reserves, believing it to be empty, was
well-nigh exterminated. On the 10th, after a nine-hour night
bombardment with torpedoes, units of the XVth and XVIIIth&nbsp;C.A.
attacked the village. Although numbering more than six to one, it was
only after four successive attacks that they gained a footing in the
ruins of a block of houses behind the church. Soon after they advanced
as far as the ruins of the church. Five times they sought to debouch,
but were each time literally mowed down by the fire of the French
machine-guns and mountain batteries. After two costly checks on
March&nbsp;16th and 18th the Germans again attacked on the evening of
the 30th, but it was only three days later and at the cost of very
heavy casualties that they were able to take and keep the village.</p>

Douaumont.</p>

<p>About 500 yards farther on is the site of what was the village of
<b>Fleury-devant-Douaumont</b>.</p>

<p>From June&nbsp;21st to September&nbsp;30th, 1916, the village was
often disputed. After violently bombarding it from June&nbsp;21st to
23rd, four German Alpine regiments carried it, pushing forward to the
south of the Fleury-Vaux railway where the French 75’s checked them
with very heavy loss. On the 24th–25th the French reoccupied the
eastern part of the village. On the 27th two battalions of the French
241st&nbsp;line regiment entered Fleury, but were soon driven out,
after which they clung to the southern and western parts. The enemy
bombardment of July 9th–10th levelled the village. On the 11th, picked
German troops attacked and outflanked it on the south.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> French
counter-attacks succeeded on the following days in driving the Germans
back somewhat, 800 prisoners being taken in ten days. On
August&nbsp;2nd–3rd the village was reoccupied and 1,350 more prisoners
taken. It was lost, then partly retaken on August&nbsp;5th at the point
of the bayonet. Two weeks of constant grenade fighting, from hole to
hole, by battalions of Alpine Chasseurs from Alsace, carried all that
remained of the trenches adjoining the positions “Trois Arbres” and
“Montbrison.” On August&nbsp;17th the Moroccan Colonial Regiment
finished the conquest of the village with their usual dash.</p>

<div class="caption">FLEURY IN RUINS, OCTOBER, 1916.</div>
</div>

<p><b>Thiaumont Redoubt</b>, S.W. of Douaumont Fort, dominating
Froide-Terre Hill and the Bras road to the W., and the Fleury road to
the S., formed the left extremity of the last but one line of
resistance which passed in front of Verdun, <i>via</i> the village of
Fleury and the forts of Souville and Tavannes. For five months
(May–September, 1916), which saw some of the hardest fighting in the
battle of Verdun, the Germans wore themselves down against this line.
Neither the repeated furious attacks, nor poison gas, nor the
incredibly intense bombardments could break the resistance of the
French, who clung desperately to their positions.</p>

<p><i>A little further on the road passes the site of</i> <b>Thiaumont
Farm</b>, <i>all traces of which were swept away by the
battle</i>.</p>

<p><b>Thiaumont Farm</b>, captured on June&nbsp;1st, was reconquered on
the 2nd. The enemy occupied the ruins on the 9th, after their big
attack of the previous day. On the 12th, 13th, 15th and 17th they
sustained four serious checks in front of the defences. Exasperated at
the French resistance, they deluged the positions and those of
Froide-Terre, on the 21st, with poison gas and more than 100,000
shells. At 6 o’clock on the morning of the 23rd five Bavarian regiments
attacked, but although they reached the defences of <span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> Froide-Terre, they
were unable to hold them. However, those of Thiaumont remained in their
hands. In a magnificent attack on June&nbsp;30th, and despite enemy
cross-fire, the French&nbsp;248th line regiment reoccupied Thiaumont at
noon, lost it at four&nbsp;o’clock, but recaptured it again the next
day and kept it until relieved, in spite of furious German
counter-attacks. From July&nbsp;4th to 9th Thiaumont was retaken and
lost four times by the Germans, but a fifth attack enabled them to hold
it. Fighting around the defences was continual during the rest of the
month. From August&nbsp;1st to 4th the French 96th&nbsp;line regiment,
supported by the 122nd, reconquered Thiaumont and its approaches. From
the 4th to the 8th it was defended by the 81st, but on the evening of
the 8th, after losing and retaking it, they were driven out by a
powerful German attack. Since June&nbsp;23rd Thiaumont had changed
hands sixteen times.</p>

<h4>DOUAUMONT FORT</h4>

<p class="h4sub">(<i>See <a href="#fig020">photo, p.&nbsp;29</a>.</i>)</p>

<p>This modern stronghold, which the Crown Prince called “the
N.E. angular pillar of the permanent fortifications of Verdun,”
occupies at Hill&nbsp;388 the culminating point of the hard limestone
plateau which forms the region of Verdun. Lying between Bras Ravine
(which descends towards the W. and the Meuse) and Vaux or Bazil
Ravine (extending towards the E. and the Woevre), the fort dominates
the entire region. As the key of the battlefield it was fiercely
disputed.</p>

<p>Before the battle of 1916 it was only bombarded twice by the German
artillery. Of the 250 shells fired at it early in November, 1914, 170
reached the mark without, however, causing serious damage. The few
8-inch shells received on March&nbsp;29th, 1915, did no damage
whatever.</p>

<p>On February&nbsp;25th, 1916, almost at the beginning of the battle,
units of the German XXIVth Infantry Regiment (IIIrd Brandenburgers),
wearing French Zouave uniforms, surprised and occupied the fort. On the
morning of the 26th the French 153rd&nbsp;D.I. (20th&nbsp;C.)
counter-attacked fiercely five times, advancing their line beyond the
fort and surrounding the enemy on three <span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> sides. Thanks, however, to a
communicating trench connecting up with their lines, the enemy were
able to keep their ground. From the 26th to the 29th they furiously
attacked the approaches of the fort without being able to surround it.
A redoubt, 200 yards E. of the fort, was alternately lost and
recaptured three times on the 26th. From March&nbsp;8th to
May&nbsp;19th the fighting continued with varying fortune.</p>

<p>From the 19th to the 22nd French heavy guns bombarded the fort, the
explosion of a shell on the 20th causing hundreds of victims. To hamper
the enemy Intelligence Service six of their observation balloons were
destroyed by a French flying squadron on the morning of the 22nd. At
11.50 the 10th&nbsp;Brigade (5th&nbsp;D.I.) attacked the fort and its
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[Pg75]</a></span>
approaches. At noon the 129th&nbsp;line regiment occupied the N. and
N.W. corners of the fort. The 74th&nbsp;regiment was unable to
take the N.E. corner, but the 36th succeeded in capturing all the
trenches west of the Fort. During the night and all the next day the
enemy intensified their bombardment and increased the number of their
counter-attacks, without breaking through the defences of the
10th&nbsp;Brigade, which maintained all its gains until relieved on the
night of the 23rd. Exasperated at this check, the Germans, on the 24th,
engaged no less than an army corps of reinforcements and retook the
fort.</p>

<p>Five months later (October&nbsp;24th) they lost it again after a heavy
bombardment and attack, during which a French 16-inch shell pierced
the superstructure of the fort and started a fire. A dense fog
overhung the fort when, at 11.40&nbsp;a.m., the signal for the attack,
directed by General Mangin, was given. When, at about 2.30&nbsp;p.m. the
fog lifted, French observers perceived the Moroccan Colonials of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Nicolaï battalion scaling the ruins of the fort. On arriving there,
the latter found units of the 321st&nbsp;line regiment which, operating
<i>in liaison</i> on their right, had preceded them and already
hoisted the French flag on the ruins of the fort. Two sappers of the
19-2&nbsp;Co. of Engineers slipped into the basement of the fort, and with
the aid of four Colonials captured twenty-four German soldiers, four
officers, two guns and three machine-guns in one of the counter-scarp
shelters. Other enemy soldiers in one of the casemates surrendered,
with the German commander of the fort, on the night of the 24th. The
next morning the entire fort, together with a great quantity of arms,
munitions and foodstuffs, was in the hands of the French. Four enemy
counter-attacks on the 26th failed to retake it.</p>

village. Having learned the time of the attack, the Germans were on

Germans who, on March&nbsp;8th and 9th, had taken Hardaumont Redoubt,
only entered Caillette Wood on April&nbsp;2nd, after four days’ attacks
with asphyxiating gas and liquid fire. Despite a night march <span

74th&nbsp;line regiment (5th&nbsp;D.I.) attacked the enemy vigorously
on the morning of April&nbsp;3rd. On April&nbsp;3rd, 4th and 5th the
French retook the wood, bit by bit. On the 15th three battalions of the
36th&nbsp;line regiment and units of the 120th threw back the enemy between
Caillette and Fausse-Côte ravines, while on the 19th the
81st&nbsp;Brigade enlarged these gains. From the 24th to the 26th the
Germans tried in vain to advance. On June 1st they engaged two and a
half divisions before they were able to occupy the greater part of
Caillette Wood. Moreover, their success was only temporary, for on
October&nbsp;24th the French Division of General Passaga (“La
Gauloise”) drove them definitely out of Caillette Wood and partly from
that of Hardaumont. Nearly two enemy divisions were put out of action
and seventeen field guns, twenty-five heavy guns, including two of long
range, and numerous trench mortars were captured. The reconquest of
Hardaumont Wood was completed on December&nbsp;15th by the same
division which captured “Lorient” and Hardaumont Redoubts.</p>

<p><b>Douaumont Village</b>, situated below and 500 yards to the W. of

but Zouaves and Tirailleurs extricated it. From the 25th to the 28th

break down the resistance of the 95th&nbsp;line regiment and units of
the 153rd&nbsp;D.I. which were defending the village. On
March&nbsp;2nd, after a preliminary bombardment which destroyed the
village and isolated the battalion holding it, the CXIIIth&nbsp;German
D.I., wearing French helmets, attacked at 1.15&nbsp;p.m. on the N. and
E. The French machine-gunners soon discovered the trick, however, and
mowed them down. After a second bombardment the enemy again attacked,
overwhelming the defenders, one company of whom resisted to the last
man.</p>

<p>The remains of the French battalion took their stand fifty yards S.W.
of the village and prevented the enemy from debouching. On the 3rd two
battalions of the 172nd and 174th&nbsp;line regiments retook the village at the
point of the bayonet. During the night the Germans counter-attacked
twice unsuccessfully with heavy loss, 800 dead being counted in front of
one of the French trenches. On the 4th a third and more powerful counter-attack
succeeded in driving the French from the village, but broke down
against new positions 200 yards to the south. The French were compelled
to fall back in May and June, but returned victorious to the ruined village

a few hundred yards of Douaumont on the west. The CVth German Infantry
was cut to pieces here on the morning of February&nbsp;26th, 1916, and
on March&nbsp;2nd the XXIst&nbsp;German Division suffered a similar
fate there. During a powerful attack around Douaumont on
April&nbsp;16th the Germans occupied a small salient S. of the wood,
but were soon after partially driven out, while on December&nbsp;17th
the wood was entirely cleared of them by the Zouaves and Tirailleurs of
the 38th&nbsp;D.I. The enemy’s efforts to retake it and Albain Wood to
the S.W. were unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Around these positions, which dominate the ravine debouching at the
stream near Bras, furious indecisive fighting took place, more
especially on March&nbsp;18th, April&nbsp;22nd and May&nbsp;8th, 9th,
10th, 22nd, 26th and 27th, 1916. They were finally taken on
October&nbsp;24th by the French&nbsp;11th line regiment.</p>

<p>Fighting was very bitter around the quarries, which form a rough oblong
200 to 300 yards long, fifty to sixty yards wide, visible from afar on account
of their white colour. The enemy had cut galleries, casemates and shelters
in the chalky soil, the whole forming a redoubtable position. After encircling
the quarries, the French captured them with grenades.</p>

<h4>Louvemont and Poivre Hill</h4>

<p>At 2.20&nbsp;p.m. on February&nbsp;24th, strong enemy forces
debouched between <b>Louvemont</b> and <b>Hill&nbsp;347</b>. During the
night the first French reinforcements, belonging to the 20th&nbsp;C.A.,
repulsed them. On the 25th, the enemy, in dense formation, outflanked
the village on the W. and E. They were checked several times by units
of the 37th&nbsp;D.I. and artillery fire, but succeeded in entering the
village at 3&nbsp;p.m., after having practically levelled it by shell
fire.</p>

<p>Zouaves, who were still clinging to the outskirts, ran short of
ammunition, but on being reinforced by a battalion of Tirailleurs with
50,000 cartridges, continued with the latter to defend the
S.E. approaches of the village until the morrow.</p>

<p>Owing to their heavy losses, the French 37th&nbsp;D.I. was compelled
to fall back, but the fire from a hundred 75&nbsp;mm. guns concentrated
at Froide-Terre held the Germans in check and prevented their
debouching from the village. The French 39th&nbsp;D.I. promptly took up
positions in front of the 37th, between Poivre Hill and the Meuse, and
barred the road to Bras. Louvemont and its approaches were brilliantly
retaken during the French offensive of December&nbsp;15th, 1916. While
a brigade of the 126th&nbsp;D.I. captured Hill&nbsp;342 in several
rushes, the 4th&nbsp;Moroccan Brigade of the 38th&nbsp;D.I., in a
running attack, carried the first and second enemy lines, Louvemont and
Hill&nbsp;347, as well as a fortified cavern known as the camp du
Henrias, before which one of the victors of Douaumont, Major Nicolaï,
was killed.</p>

<p>On August&nbsp;20th, 1917, four successive lines of trenches were
taken by the French 165th&nbsp;D.I., in an attack to the north of
Louvemont.</p>

<p>After several checks (<i>e.g.</i> February&nbsp;25th and

unable to dislodge the French from the woods to the S.E.</p>

<p>From March, they organised a network of barbed-wire entanglements,
concrete galleries, redoubts, shelters, etc., on the hill, converting
it into a kind of fortress, but on December&nbsp;15th the village and
hill were rushed by the 112th&nbsp;line regiment in three-column
formation, covered on the left by a fourth column and supported by
auto-cannon. Veritable bastion, overlooking the Beaumont road and
flanking the entire German line, the village could only be captured by
surprise, and the latter was complete. German officers were taken in
their shelters while dressing. The attack had not been expected before

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Mort-Homme.</b>—Like Hill&nbsp;304, Mort-Homme was one of the most
fiercely disputed positions on the left bank. It consists of twin
hills: No. 265 (of which the Béthincourt-Cumières road skirts the
summit) and No. 295 (the Mort-Homme proper, round which the road winds
on the N.E.), and formed an excellent observation-post and artillery
position in front of the real line of resistance.</p>

<p>On March&nbsp;5th, 1916, the German offensive, which, until then,
had been confined to the right bank of the river, developed with great
violence on the left flank, progressing in six days to the slopes of
Mort-Homme.</p>

<p>On the 14th, after a five-hours bombardment with shells of every
kind and size, sometimes at the rate of 120 a minute, the enemy’s
Infantry attack on Mort-Homme began. The Germans took and kept Hill
265, but the French Infantry and Zouaves, after a magnificent defence,
held their ground on Hill&nbsp;295—the key to the entire position—and
in night counter-attacks drove back the assailants to the N.W.
counter-slopes.</p>

<p>From March&nbsp;15th to the end of December, 1916, the Germans
launched at least fifteen particularly violent attacks against
Hill&nbsp;295, sacrificing countless men and huge quantities of
munitions. On March&nbsp;16th, 17th and 31st, and April&nbsp;9th and
10th, French Chasseurs and Infantry repulsed the enemy in terrible
hand-to-hand fighting. On April&nbsp;22nd, 23rd and 24th the French
40th&nbsp;D.I., by its resistance and brilliant counter-attacks, broke
up as many as three enemy attacks in one day, and re-established the
French front as it was on April&nbsp;5th. Further German attacks on
Hill&nbsp;295 followed on May&nbsp;7th, 20th and 22nd, June&nbsp;29th,
July&nbsp;12th and December&nbsp;28th. Their furious offensive of May
20th alone brought them momentarily on the S.W. crest of Hill&nbsp;295
and as far as the French second-line trenches, which were retaken on
June&nbsp;15th.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>At that time the sector of Mort-Homme and Hill&nbsp;304 was
commanded by General de Maud’huy, whose courage and coolness are
legendary in the army. The exploits of the French troops at Mort-Homme
during the difficult period of 1916 were countless. One of the most
brilliant was accomplished on April&nbsp;9th by the 11th&nbsp;Company
of the 151st&nbsp;Regiment of Infantry, which had received orders to
reconquer the crest of the Mort-Homme.</p>

<p>Laughing and singing under a continual bombardment, this company
went into line, a section at a time, with measured step and rifle in
hand. On approaching the enemy trenches, the men rushed forward under
heavy machine-gun fire and captured a large and important network of
trenches. Promptly organising the conquered trenches, and despite an
extremely intense enemy bombardment of thirty-six hours, the men
succeeded in re-establishing the <i>liaison</i> with the
8th&nbsp;Battalion of Chasseurs on their right, making it possible to
reform the line which had been broken, and which the enemy afterwards
tried in vain to pierce, until May&nbsp;20th.</p>

<p>In 1917 the sector was often the scene of violent combats,
especially on January&nbsp;25th, and March&nbsp;18th, 20th and 29th.
After many efforts and at heavy cost the Germans succeeded in occupying
Hill&nbsp;265 and the crest of Hill&nbsp;295, where they organised
formidable defences, including deep shell-proof tunnels.</p>

<p>On August&nbsp;20th, 1917, during the French attack along the entire
Verdun front, the 31st&nbsp;D.I. carried all the German defences and
recaptured the Mort-Homme and its tunnels, including the one known as
the “<b>Crown-Prince</b>,” which was “cleaned out” by the Foreign
Legion. In one of the tunnels several cavalry-men, units of the XXXVIth
and a whole battalion of the XXth&nbsp;Regiment of the German Reserve,
were captured, while among the officers taken <span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> was Count Bernstorff, nephew of the
ex-German Ambassador to the United States. An entire staff was captured
in another of the tunnels.</p>

<p><b>Corbeaux Wood.</b>—The plateaux dominated by the two Mort-Homme
Hills are cut into on the north of the high road by a ravine bordered
by Corbeaux Wood. This wood offers favourable cover for the massing of
attacking troops. It was by this fiercely disputed route that the enemy
tried to reach Hill&nbsp;295. On March&nbsp;6th the French line was
brought back in front of the wood. On the 7th the enemy, after
bombarding it, succeeded in getting a footing there, but on the
following day the 92nd&nbsp;Infantry Regiment, in a magnificent
counter-attack, retook the wood in twenty minutes. On the morning of
the 10th, reinforced by another infantry battalion, the same regiment
further captured the N.E. outskirts of Cumières Wood (to the E. of
Corbeaux Wood), but in the evening, deprived of its commanding officer
(Colonel Macker, who had fallen that morning), and lacking the support
of the French artillery, which the trees prevented from seeing the
rocket-signals, the regiment was compelled to fall back before an
impetuous attack by a whole enemy division. However, it was only at
frightful cost that the Germans were able to score these two successes,
as the French gave ground only inch by inch.</p>

<p>The wood was retaken by the Foreign Legion Regiment on
August&nbsp;20th, 1917 (<i>see <a

<p>By reason of its position, S. of Hills&nbsp;304 and 295, Esnes was
an important base of operations during the Battle of Verdun. It was
subjected to frequent enemy bombardments, of which the most violent
occurred on March&nbsp;20th and 21st, April&nbsp;5th, 6th, 12th, 25th
and 26th, and June&nbsp;22nd, 1916.</p>

</div>

<h4>HILL 304</h4>

<p><b>Hill&nbsp;304</b>, with Hills&nbsp;287, 310 and 275, forms from
Malancourt to Marre Fort a line of natural fortresses, which kept under
their cross-fire not only the roads of approach, but also the bare
glacis and the abrupt escarpments immediately bordering them.</p>

<p>The covered ground nearest Hill&nbsp;304 is the S.E. corner of
Avocourt Wood. It was from this wood that the IInd&nbsp;Bavarian D.I.
left to attack the Hill on March&nbsp;20th, 1916.</p>

<p>They were checked, however, on the long barren slope leading to the
ridge, by the French cross-fire. Their three regiments, on
March&nbsp;20th to 22nd, lost from fifty to sixty&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent.
of their effective strength, without gain. On April&nbsp;9th, before
Hill&nbsp;287, the first German attacking wave succeeded in crossing
the French first-line trench, practically destroyed by bombardment.
They were running towards the French supporting trench when the
survivors of the front-line trench, coming out of their shelters in the
upheaved ground among the dead, exterminated them to the last man.</p>

<p>On May&nbsp;3rd, eighty German batteries concentrated their fire on
Hill&nbsp;304 and its approaches. Clouds of black, green and yellow
smoke rose from the hill-top as from a volcano, obscuring the sky to a
height of 2,500 feet, according to the reports of aviators. As a
British war correspondent put it: “The sky was like a dome of invisible
rails on which fast trains ran madly.” On May&nbsp;4th and 5th a fresh
German division attempted to occupy the position, believing it and its
defenders to have been annihilated. They gained a footing on the
N.&nbsp;slopes of the hill, but were driven back during the night by
the French 68th&nbsp;R.I., which then withdrew. On the 5th the same
German division attacked on the left the Camard Wood and Hill&nbsp;287.
In this wood, entirely levelled by an eleven-hour bombardment, the
66th&nbsp;Line R.I. first held up, then charged the assailants at the
point of the bayonet. At Hill&nbsp;287 a battalion of the
32nd&nbsp;Line R.I. likewise brilliantly repulsed two attacks. On
May&nbsp;7th, after a tremendous shelling, the enemy attacked
Hill&nbsp;304 simultaneously from three sides with troops from five
different divisions. It was their greatest effort against this
position. However, two French regiments of picked troops (125th and
114th), one company of which charged, to the strains of <i>La
Marseillaise</i>, the Germans were thrown into disorder and driven back
to the N.&nbsp;slopes. During the rest of the month the enemy
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
counter-attacked continually, at times in force, as on May&nbsp;18th,
20th and 22nd, but without success.</p>

<div class="subcap">Reconquered August 24th, 1917.</div>
</div>

<p>On June&nbsp;29th and 30th they sought to turn the Hill from the E.
and W. with the help of liquid fire. On the E. desperate fighting took
place around a work which was lost by the French on the 29th, then
retaken, lost again, and reconquered on the 30th.</p>

<p>The Germans made a powerful attack on December&nbsp;6th, in which
they took several trenches on the E.&nbsp;slopes.</p>

<p>On the 28th of the same month another German attack, preceded by an
intense bombardment, failed.</p>

<p>In 1917 the enemy continued their efforts against Hill&nbsp;304. They
succeeded on January&nbsp;25th in occupying several of the French
advance-positions, which were partly recaptured the next day.</p>

<p>Further enemy attacks on March&nbsp;18th, 20th and 29th were repulsed
after hand-to-hand fighting.</p>

<p>On June&nbsp;28th and 29th another powerful enemy attack succeeded,
with heavy loss, in capturing Hill&nbsp;304 and advancing between the
Hill and the S.E.&nbsp;corner of Avocourt Wood, to a slight hollow
known as the <b>Col-de-Pommerieux</b>. This hollow was, however,
reconquered on July&nbsp;17th by the French&nbsp;51st and
87th&nbsp;R.I., supported by two battalions of the 97th&nbsp;D.I.
(335th and 346th&nbsp;Regiments), and one battalion of the
73rd&nbsp;D.I. After a remarkable artillery preparation, the French
infantrymen, in half-an-hour, reached the fortified crest, and regained
a kilometer of ground, including the famous “Demi-Lune” Redoubt. The
87th&nbsp;R.I., composed of men from the north, Valenciennes,
St.&nbsp;Quentin and Lens, went 300&nbsp;yards beyond the assigned objective
and captured an observation-post in front of the crest, which they
christened “<i>Le crèneau des Gretchen</i>.” The attack occurred at the
time the enemy troops were being relieved, 520&nbsp;prisoners,
belonging to at least three different divisions, being taken. From a
single sap the French Grenadiers brought out four German officers, one
of whom, on descending the hill, turned back to admire the manœuvre of
the French soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>On August&nbsp;24th Hill&nbsp;304, the approaches to which had been
reconquered on the 20th, was carried by the 139th and 121st&nbsp;R.I.
(26th&nbsp;D.I.). This division, which attacked before Hill&nbsp;304, on the
Pommerieux Plateau and at Camard Wood, captured prisoners belonging to
five different German divisions. After capturing Hill&nbsp;304, Equerre
Wood and Souvin Redoubt, the division attacked again on the evening of
the same day, this time carrying the positions of Palavas, Alsace,
Gateau-de-Miel and Lorraine, and advancing the first French line to
the Forges stream, <i>i.e.</i> more than two&nbsp;kilometers from its
starting-point between Haucourt and Malancourt, the latter still being
occupied by the enemy.</p>

attacked by the Germans on April&nbsp;4th, 1916, and taken after
several sanguinary setbacks on the night of the 5th after a fine
defence by three companies of the 79th&nbsp;R.I., which held their
ground against a brigade. It was recaptured on September&nbsp;26th,
1918, by the First American Army.</p>

<p><b>Malancourt</b> village was reoccupied by the French on
October&nbsp;13th, 1914. Enemy attacks on the following 16th and 20th
failed. From February, 1915, the French lines were advanced to the
slopes on the N.&nbsp;of the village. In 1916 the Germans did not
attack until the end of March. They were unable to enter it on the
28th, but the next day captured two houses. On the night of the 30th
they occupied it entirely.</p>

<p>Malancourt and its wood were recaptured by the First American Army
on September&nbsp;26th, 1918. The wood was hard to take, as the Germans had
installed numerous blockhouses and barbed-wire entanglements.</p>

<p>On March&nbsp;20th, 1916, the Germans, who had never been able to take
the village, attacked with a fresh division of picked troops
(IInd&nbsp;Bavarians), which had taken part in the summer campaign in Galicia and
Poland with Mackensen’s forces. The attack succeeded, with the help of
liquid fire. A French counter-attack on the 29th by the 210th&nbsp;R.I.,
and a battalion of the 157th, recaptured the wood and the redoubt
known as the “Réduit d’Avocourt,” situated on its S.&nbsp;edge. The
attacking troops, which had not been revictualled for four days, had
finished their reserve rations twelve hours previously. So fatigued
were they that they slept standing despite the bombardment. To rouse
them, their chiefs, at 3&nbsp;a.m. next morning, ordered the buglers and
drummers to play. As the day was breaking the music suddenly stopped,
a shell having buried all save one drummer. Furious at this, the men,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
with the drummer at their head, rushed forward, and by 8&nbsp;a.m.  the
wood had been entirely reconquered.</p>

<p>In 1917, hard fighting continued in this region with varying

Avocourt and Hill&nbsp;304, and in Avocourt Wood. On August&nbsp;20th,

<p>On September&nbsp;26th, 1918, the wood was entirely cleared of the
enemy by the First&nbsp;American Army.</p>

<p><b>Malancourt Wood.</b>—It was against a French trench, in this
wood that on February&nbsp;26th, 1915, the Germans made use of <b>liquid
fire for the first time</b>, special pumps, operated by pioneers of
the Guard, being employed.</p>

<h4>VII.—Avocourt to Aubréville</h4>

<p><i>From Avocourt take the road which follows the small valley
running southwards (see <a href="#map024">Itinerary</a>, pp.&nbsp;88 and
89). It was on this road, hidden from the view of the enemy, that the
French concentrations were carried out in the rear lines.</i></p>

<p><i>Two kilometers from Avocourt, take on the left the road leading
to Hesse Wood, scene of all sorts of concentrations, posts of
commandment, dressing stations, batteries of artillery, depots,
etc.</i></p>

<p><i>This road is in good condition almost as far as Aubréville, with
the exception of two or three places on leaving Hesse Wood, beyond
Bertrame’s Farm.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<h4>VIII.—From Aubréville to Verdun</h4>

<p><i>On entering Aubréville, take on the left N.&nbsp;46 which skirts
the St.&nbsp;Menehould-Verdun railway.</i></p>

<p><i>The tourist passes through Parois and Récicourt, where numerous
cantonments and rest camps were installed for the relief of the
troops.</i></p>

<p><i>Dombasle, where a large munitions depot blew up, is next
reached.</i></p>

<p><i>From Dombasle one of two Itineraries may be chosen to return to
Verdun.</i></p>

<p><i>The first, by continuing to follow the National Road, via
Blercourt.</i></p>

<p><i>The second, which follows the crests dominating N.&nbsp;3 from
Paris to Metz.</i></p>

<p><i>For the second Itinerary, on leaving Dombasle, take the small
road on the left, which leads to Sivry-la-Perche, 4&nbsp;kilometers
distant.</i></p>

<p>N. of the latter village, at the N.E.&nbsp;extremity of
Hill&nbsp;357, there still exists an observation-post, from which there
is a general view of the entire rear-ground of the battlefield W. of
Verdun.</p>

<p>If it is desired to visit this observation-post before the descent
leading to Sivry-la-Perche, take the Béthelainville road on the left
for about 700&nbsp;yards going thence on foot to the right in a
N.E.&nbsp;direction. The observation post is about half-a mile further
on.</p>

<p>From Sivry-la-Perche continue along the road, which passes first on
the left of <b>Sartelles Fort</b> and then to the left of <b>Chaume
Fort</b>. These two forts only played a minor role in the battle of
Verdun, and suffered but slightly from the bombardments. In front of
Chaume Fort there was an observation post for heavy artillery, whence
there is a splendid view of the Meuse Valley.</p>

<p><i>From Chaume Fort the road is rather steep and in bad condition.
Going down on the left and flanking a hill is</i> Glorieux Cemetery,
near the evacuation hospital.</p>

<p><i>Verdun is entered by the Porte-de-France.</i></p>

 <p class="advtitle1">BEAUTIFUL FRANCE.</p>

<p class="advtitle3 italic">Brittany.</p>

<p>Land of granite cliffs, rough seas and folk-lore, Brittany
is one of the most picturesque provinces of France.</p>

<p>The granitic soil, carpeted with yellow-gorse and shaded
with the deep green of countless oaks, has bred a hardy race
of sailors and fishermen, who combine strange pagan superstitions
with the Roman faith. In historic and pre-historic
memories, it is one of the richest lands in the world.</p>

<p>The hinterland of Brittany consists of uplands broken by
ravines, of low undulating hills, moors, rich pastures, living
waters and crags.</p>

<p>The coastline, broken with innumerable capes, creeks,
gulfs and estuaries, is of unparalleled picturesqueness.</p>

<p>Among the principal places of interest to tourists are the
following: Cancale Bay and Grouin Point, the roadstead of
St. Malo and estuary of the Rance, Cape Fréhel, St. Brieuc
Bay, Bréhat Island, Ploumanach and Trégastel Cliffs, Primel
Point, the estuary of the de Morlaix river, Roscoff and Batz
Island, the Brignognan and Aber-Wrach Crags, St. Matthew’s
Point and Brest Harbour.</p>

<p>Further south are the Morgat Caves, Bay of Douarnenez,
Raz Point, Penmarch Cliffs, Gulf of Vannes, etc.</p>

<p>Numerous ancient fortified cities, whereof: Vitré,
Fougères, St. Malo, Dinan, Morlaix, Carhaix, Quimper,
Concarneau, Pontivy and Vannes are of especial interest, and
old-time châteaux, churches and cathedrals lie scattered over
the land.</p>

<p>The three principal “Calvaries,” of which there are
many, are in the “Département” of Finistère, at Trégonnec,
Guimiliau and Plougastel.</p>

<p>Numerous “menhirs” and “dolmens,” of which the most
celebrated are at Carnac and Lochmariaquer, offer particular
interest to the archaeologist and historian.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
